#Personal AI Assistant Project

This is a private developer project for my own personal use. I am the only user of this system. The purpose of this project is to connect my personal mobile phone to an AI assistant using SMS for my own utilities, research, and personal productivity. This system is not used for marketing, commercial messaging, or third-party communications.

### Privacy Policy

No mobile information will be shared with third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes. SMS messages and phone numbers are used only to send my requests to the AI service and return responses back to my own device.

All text-messaging originator opt-in data and consent applies only to me as the system owner. No messages are ever sent to external users and no personal data is shared with any third parties except providers required to operate the system (such as Twilio and an AI API service).

### Terms of Service

This is a private, single-user application used only by me. I manually add my own phone number to my private application configuration and I am the only recipient of messages sent through this system.

This application is not used for bulk messaging, marketing, or unsolicited messages.

The service is provided for personal use only and is operated “as-is” without any guarantees of uptime or delivery.

### Opt-In / Opt-Out

Opt-In: I opt myself in manually as the system owner by initiating messages to my own number.

Opt-Out: Reply STOP to end all messaging at any time. Since I am the only user of this system, this applies only to my own phone number.
